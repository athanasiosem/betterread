# Features
betterread is a simple Chrome/Edge extension that changes the CSS style of a website for better reading experience. 
The extension is useful when browsing sites that:
- have all their body layout left-aligned,
- have small fonts, 
- have no or little line-height 
- have more than 80 characters long sentences. 

### SPECIAL NOTE: The extension takes a general approach and is not site specific, therefore, it will not work on all websites. Where it shines are old webpages that are not designed for readability.

# Installation
At this time, you can only install the extension from its source. First of all, [download the extension zip file](https://github.com/athanasiosem/betterread/archive/refs/tags/v1.0.0.zip). After you have downloaded the file, unzip it to a destination of your choice. Next, open the "Extensions" page (chrome://extensions/) in the browser and turn on the "Developer mode".
Click on the "Load unpacked" button and select the directory where you unzipped the extension. The betterread extension is now installed.

# Usage
To use the extension just click on the extension icon to toggle it on or off.
